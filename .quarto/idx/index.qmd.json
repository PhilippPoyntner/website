Using household-level data from the OeNB's Euro Survey for the period 2008--2018, we address the question whether interpersonal comparisons (\"Keeping up with the Novaks\") are associated with the probability of having a loan and planning to take out a loan. Applying multilevel probit modeling to consider the hierarchical structure of the data, our results support the notion that higher income inequality is negatively correlated with the probability of having a loan at the bottom of the distribution, and positively at the top. We show this impact for almost all components of household debt, but evidence is strongest for mortgage and foreign currency loans. Loan plans are associated with income inequality at the very top of the income distribution.\n</p>\n</details>\n\nHake, M., & Poyntner, P. (2019).

For this purpose, we estimate the effects of a QE shock on housing and risky financial asset prices by means of local projections. We then use these estimates to carry out micro-simulations based on data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). For the majority of the countries under review, expansionary QE via asset prices leads to net wealth inequality increases when measured using wealth indicators that are sensitive to changes at the tails of the wealth distribution. This finding contrasts with results based on the Gini coefficient which point to an equalizing impact of QE. One-third of the households in our sample holds neither housing nor financial wealth and is thus not directly affected by QE measures through the asset prices channel.\n</p>\n</details> \n<details>\n<summary>Other versions</summary>\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">\n<a href=\"https://research.wu.ac.at/en/publications/effects-of-the-ecbs-unconventional-monetary-policy-on-real-and-fi-9\">WU Department of Economics Working Paper Series</a>\n</p>\n</details> \n\nPoyntner, P., & Reininger, T. (2018). Bail-in and Legacy Assets: Harmonized rules for targeted partial compensation to strengthen the bail-in regime. OeNB Working Paper 224.\n<details>\n<summary>Abstract</summary>\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">\nIn the wake of the global financial crisis, several large bank rescues by governments further\nentrenched bail-out expectations in the wider public. Then, following a problematic ad-hoc\nbail-in in Cyprus early 2013, EU rules introduced provisions for ‘bail-in’, that is, the\nadministrative power to require write-down or conversion into equity of non-equity claims – a\nsignificant regime change to deal with banks failing or likely to fail. This paper focuses on the implications of this regime change for consumer/investor protection, especially for socially more vulnerable households, and on the resulting risk for political acceptance and the\nachievement of the bail-in objective. Therefore, it reviews these rules and their application in\nrecent cases, focusing on the treatment of retail bond holders. Moreover, it explores the\ndistribution of retail holders of bank bonds across economy-wide income quantiles in the\neuro area and various euro area countries. We find that neither the share of below-median-\nincome households with bank bonds in the total number of households with bank bonds nor\nthe relative vulnerability to ‘bail-in’ of these households that tend to have higher levels of\nfinancial illiterateness are negligible. Recent applications of bail-in-rules, while diverse with\nrespect to legal basis, scope and purpose, have barely gone beyond the write-down and\nconversion of capital instruments, thus excluding senior bonds. Nevertheless, in all these\ncases, some sort of compensation scheme for retail investors was deemed necessary and\nimplemented, varying in design, but mostly benefiting almost all retail holders. In two\nprominent cases there was no effective bail-in of retail holders. In conclusion, following a\nlesser-known example from Italy, we propose EU harmonized partial compensation rules for\nsocially more vulnerable retail holders of bank debt securities acquired before 2016. They\nwould render implementation of bail-in socially more acceptable, politically more feasible and\neconomically more efficient. During the transition period until household investment\nbehaviour will have fully adjusted to the new world of bail-in, the proposed compensation\nrules would help avoid effective non-application of bail-in that otherwise results from\nexcluding senior bonds and/or granting excessive compensation.\n</p>\n</details> \n\n## Work in Progress\n\nFirm-level Consequences of Corporate Quantatitive Easing\n\nUnconventional Monetary Policy and the Labour Share (with Lea Steininger, WU)\n\nHeat and construction workers’ health (with Anna-Theresa Renner, TU Vienna, and Roman Hoffmann, IIASA)\n\nPublic Perceptions of the Linkage between Monetary Policy Decisions and the Housing Market (with Sofie R.
