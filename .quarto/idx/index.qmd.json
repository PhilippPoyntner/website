Using household-level data from the OeNB's Euro Survey for the period 2008--2018, we address the question whether interpersonal comparisons (\"Keeping up with the Novaks\") are associated with the probability of having a loan and planning to take out a loan. Applying multilevel probit modeling to consider the hierarchical structure of the data, our results support the notion that higher income inequality is negatively correlated with the probability of having a loan at the bottom of the distribution, and positively at the top. We show this impact for almost all components of household debt, but evidence is strongest for mortgage and foreign currency loans. Loan plans are associated with income inequality at the very top of the income distribution.\n</p>\n</details>\n\nHake, M., & Poyntner, P. (2019).

For this purpose, we estimate the effects of a QE shock on housing and risky financial asset prices by means of local projections. We then use these estimates to carry out micro-simulations based on data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). For the majority of the countries under review, expansionary QE via asset prices leads to net wealth inequality increases when measured using wealth indicators that are sensitive to changes at the tails of the wealth distribution. This finding contrasts with results based on the Gini coefficient which point to an equalizing impact of QE. One-third of the households in our sample holds neither housing nor financial wealth and is thus not directly affected by QE measures through the asset prices channel.\n</p>\n</details> \n<details>\n<summary>Other versions</summary>\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">\n<a href=\"https://research.wu.ac.at/en/publications/effects-of-the-ecbs-unconventional-monetary-policy-on-real-and-fi-9\">WU Department of Economics Working Paper Series</a>\n</p>\n</details> \n\nPoyntner, P., & Reininger, T.
